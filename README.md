# UnturnedBlackout
Blackout was a project started by me and P9nda back in January 2021, after 11 months of working it was finally finished and released. But due to indifferences between me and P9nda it never worked out.

Keep in mind this code was worked on for over a year with a lot of changes which caused the code to loose it's hold after a while and a bit of the stuff seems rushed. I also realised the value of OOP after I made this as most of the loadout stuff could be condensed down to a few files. Same goes for the database manager, a library to parse all that could be made which could cut down on a lot of those lines.

Most of the logging done for disposing and destruction was due to me finding a fix for the memory leak issue that still exists in the plugin somewhere.

Keep in mind that this plugin requires heavy setup, there are a lot of tables and a lot of configuration files, the files are also linked to a file server, the link can be set in the configuration. If you plan to only have one server, then it's fine, otherwise you need to set that up as well to make your life easier as there are over 10 separate files just for configuration. This plugin was made to work with a central DB regardless where the server was hosted, so it should be fine on that end.

If you have any questions regarding any part you can ask, but don't expect to me reply that fast as this is a project I am just done on, and have no plans to update, work on, anymore.

Here is an example of Blackout:

Everything file related is here:

The files have an example DB in which I removed most of the rows, just kept a few to give an example as to how to set it up. The configurations are also there.
